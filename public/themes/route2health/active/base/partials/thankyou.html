                Drying is very important for safe and secure storage of paddy. It also imparts maturity to the rice grain for excellent cooking results later. Hence, paddy is received on raised platforms, scientifically designed to protect it from moisture. We have installed automatic mechanical drying system, with heat exchanger mechanism for controlled, uniform and consistent hot air supply to the system for drying. The fresh paddy is dried from 20% moisture level down to 12%. During this process, tempering of paddy is also done.
